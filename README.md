# Hybrid pin cracking approaches
To crack a 6-digit PIN in under 2 minutes and within 10 attempts using an optimized approach, we can combine the best features brute force, timing attack, SQL injection, and side-channel analysis. We'll use multithreading to parallelize the brute-force attack while leveraging timing leaks to reduce the search space.

Key Enhancements:
Multithreading: Perform simultaneous checks across multiple threads to reduce search time.
Optimized Timing Attack: Further reduce the search space by using timing information and focusing on likely digits.
SQL Injection and MitM Attacks: Use injection and partial data capture strategies as fallback methods.
Prioritize Common Pins: Always start with common PINs to avoid unnecessary work.

Key Concepts:
Multithreading: The brute force worker function runs across 8 threads, significantly speeding up the attack by parallelizing the search for the correct PIN.
Timing Attack: Used to reduce the search space for each digit in the PIN based on how long it takes to verify the correct partial PIN.
SQL Injection & Man-in-the-Middle (MITM): These attacks are simulated to bypass traditional PIN checking mechanisms, relying on common vulnerabilities.

How It Works:
SQL Injection: First attempts an SQL injection bypass.
Common PINs: It tries the most common PINs before brute-forcing everything else.
Timing Attack: Narrow down the correct digits using timing information.
Multithreaded Brute-Force: If everything else fails, brute-force using multiple threads.
MITM Attack: Simulates capturing encrypted data and deriving partial information.
